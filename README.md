# Ngonyani
I've developed Ngonyani Agriculture, an innovative program using Node.js, Express.js, and the Strapi API to revolutionize the agricultural sector by streamlining processes and improving efficiency. The platform facilitates crop management, resource allocation, and real-time data analysis, aiming to drive positive change within the industry.
